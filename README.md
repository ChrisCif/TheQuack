The Quack is a website made in HTML/CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and PHP. The site is to be used by the students of Plymouth Whitemarsh High School as a means of easily and conveniently finding extracurricular activites throughout the school.

The site was created by the Computer Science Capstone class at Plymouth Whitemarsh High School. The intent was to allow students and faculty to be able to get the word out about extracurricular actvities as well as to discover new activities. This is done by allowing heads of these groups to create pages containing information and make announcements to be displayed on the main page. The school's newspaper, The Town Crier, and the school's television broadcasting group, CITV, worked together with the developers in order to better unify the distribution of information regarding the school and the events it sponsors.

The developers first went to meet with the heads of the collaboratng groups as well as the school administrators at the start of production. A survey was also given to a large sample of the student body to better understand their needs in the site's functionality. Once all feedback was settled and planning had finished, development for the site began. Development lasted a total of four months, beginning in October 2014 and ending in January 2015. Once development had ceased, the finished product was presented to school administrators for further approval. Unfortunately, the project was never published due to lack of cooperation with the administrators.
